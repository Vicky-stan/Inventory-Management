# Data-Driven Inventory Management with SQL: Using AMAZON as a case study, perform a calculation to optimize inventory management

## Introduction
In this Project, SQL was used to analyze and optimize inventory managememt using Amazon as a case study. The focus was on improving stock efficiency, reducing overstock/stockouts, and supporting data-driven decisions.

## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of inventory data. The tasks to be completed are;
- Explore the data to determine the products that are in-stock and out-of-stock.
- Explore the data to determine the suppliers and warehouse locations and their average lead times.
- Explore the data to determine the reorder points of products.
- Explore the data to determine the holding period of products.
- Create a markdown file.
- Host the code on Github or Gitlab.

## Research Questions
- Determine the products that are in-stock and out-of-stock.
